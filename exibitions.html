            <h3>Biology and Medicine</h3>
            <p>
                From micro-organisms to the human body, major 
                breakthroughs in biology are offering us unique 
                insights into the great wonders of the tiny world. 
            </p>
            <p>
                For many people their life expectancy is much 
                longer and their quality of life much improved, 
                thanks to the growth of our understanding of medicine. 
                Over a series of exhibits we explore the history of medicine 
                and take a look at some major breakthroughs including 
                the discovery of penicillin and the first heart transplant.
            </p>
            <p>
                Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come 
                not only from the lab, but also from observing animals 
                in the wild. Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.

            <h3>Evolution</h3>
            <p>
                For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled 
                with the question of our origins. Where do we come from 
                and how did we get here? Since Darwin proposed his theory 
                of evolution we have had a framework for exploring and 
                understanding our place in this world.
            </p>
            <p>
                Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the 
                species we know today have evolved our time. You can 
                also take some time to meet a few of the creatures who 
                didn’t survive, including our Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, 
                and a number of dinosaurs too.

            <h3>Cosmology</h3>
            <p>
                Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition, 
                ‘The Sky Above Us’, explores the night sky and what we 
                can see and know about the universe around us. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We’ll locate the various constellations and galaxies 
                that can be seen and learn a bit about the early navigators 
                who used the stars to travel by.
            </p>
            <p>
                Follow the journey of our solar exploration: 
                from early Arab traders, to Galileo’s telescope, 
                to the latest exploration of the planets in our solar system.

            <h3>Ecology</h3>
            <p>
                As we learn more and more of the impact humans are 
                having on the planet, the more important it becomes 
                that scientists explore how to create a sustainable 
                future not just for humans but for the whole planet.
            </p>
            <p>
                In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack the 
                dangers we currently face including global warming, 
                extinction of species, and pollution. But we also 
                focus on the positive ways we can all contribute 
                to a brighter future.

            <h3>Robotics and AI</h3>
            <p>
                The information revolution is here and robotics 
                and artificial intelligence are the science of the future. 
            </p>
            <p>
                From useful home applications of AI to industrial uses 
                of robotics, the future is here. You can even say hello 
                and shake the hand of Rob the Robot.
