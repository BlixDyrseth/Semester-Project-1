         <p>
            Come join us at the Community Science Museum where we’re 
            committed to making science accessible to all.
            Over the course of human history, science has developed 
            from our early understanding of fire, wind, water, and earth to
             exploring everything from galaxies far away to the very building 
             blocks of life itself.
         </p>
         <p>
            The aim of our museum is to create a space where everyone can experience 
            the wonders of our discoveries and perhaps even ignite a lifelong passion 
            to continue the exploration of the world around us.
         </p>
         <p>
            We believe science should not be confined to the textbook, but brought 
            to live through exhibits. This is why we have over 1000 different exhibits 
            on the many varied subjects of science to explore. Many of these exhibits 
            are designed for you to interact with and play around to see science come to life 
            (apart from the dinosaur exhibits – they only come to life at night when everyone’s gone home).

            <h3>Volunteer</h3>
            <p>
                A number of people volunteer their time and effort to keep 
                the displays in good order and ready for visitors to come and enjoy. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Volunteering has its perks including getting to see behind the scenes 
                of a working museum, access to staff-only lectures, and a monthly lunch 
                where all staff and volunteers come together to discuss ideas for future 
                exhibits and strategies for the museum.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can help volunteer in a number of different spheres. 
                Please contact us if you’d like to find out more about how you can get involved.
