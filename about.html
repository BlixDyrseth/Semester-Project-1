          <h3>Welcome</h3>
         <p>
             Come join us at the Community Science Museum where 
             we’re committed to making science accessible to all.
             Over the course of human history, science has developed 
             from our early understanding of fire, wind, water, 
             and earth to exploring everything from galaxies far 
             away to the very building blocks of life itself.
         </p>
         <p>
            The aim of our museum is to create a space where 
            everyone can experience the wonders of our discoveries 
            and perhaps even ignite a lifelong passion 
            to continue the exploration of the world around us.
         </p>
         <p>
            We believe science should not be confined to the textbook, 
            but brought to live through exhibits. This is why we have 
            over 1000 different exhibits on the many varied subjects of 
            science to explore. Many of these exhibits are designed for 
            you to interact with and play around to see science come to life 
            (apart from the dinosaur exhibits – they only come to life at 
            night when everyone’s gone home).

            <h3>Internships</h3>
            <p>
                Are you interested in working in a museum? Do you enjoy 
                the fun and excitement of sharing the wonders of nature with 
                people? Well you could be just the right person to enjoy an 
                internship at the museum.
            </p>
            <p>
                You’ll be learning from a number of different academics 
                and people who are passionate about science and sharing 
                it with the wider community.

            <h3>Volunteer</h3>
            <p>
                A number of people volunteer their time and 
                effort to keep the displays in good order and ready 
                for visitors to come and enjoy. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Volunteering has its perks including getting to see 
                behind the scenes of a working museum, access to 
                staff-only lectures, and a monthly lunch where all staff 
                and volunteers come together to discuss ideas for future 
                exhibits and strategies for the museum.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can help volunteer in a number of different spheres. 
                Please contact us if you’d like to find out more about 
                how you can get involved.
